This is my first time setting up a reverse proxy using NGINX, so I coded along side with GPT, first to understand the flow of the project requirement. It is an interesting project it exposes my knowledge to a wider range of possiblity using a Reverse Proxy acting as a failover load balancer.

Some of its Reallife uses case include:
- Deploy new app version safely without stopping the old one
- Keep backup instance ready in case the active one fails
